# Introduction:

This repository contains the code for the GeoLifeClef 2022 competition hosted by the LifeCLEF 2022 lab of the CLEF 2022 conference, and of the FGVC9 workshop organized in conjunction with CVPR 2022 conference.

# Background

The rise of deep learning in image/object recognition tasks has opened the gate for uncovering elusive relationships in nature previously unbeknownst to humans. This particular project aims to leverage this, by utilizng CNN's for plant and species recognition in a variety of areas scattered throughout the United States and France. More specifically, for an arbitrary patch of land we aim to predict 17K+ species (9K plant species and 8K animal species). In doing so , we hope to improve species identification tools for biodiversity management and conservation.
